# 6. Marketing & Sales Strategy

## 6.1 Overall Marketing Strategy

**Strategic Approach: Performance-Led Hybrid (Informed Outbound + Case Study Driven Inbound)**

Our marketing strategy recognizes that our core value proposition (AI-powered TikTok traffic at scale) appeals to sophisticated B2B buyers who demand proof before commitment. We employ a hybrid approach where outbound efforts target high-intent prospects with direct value, while inbound channels nurture interested leads through documented case studies and performance transparency.

**Strategic Rationale:**

| Factor | Approach | Justification |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Target Audience Sophistication** | Outbound-first | SMB owners and agency principals are busy decision-makers who don't discover vendors through content marketing alone |
| **Proof Requirements** | Case study-driven | Our model is novel and potentially skeptical; prospects need verifiable ROI data before engaging |
| **Sales Cycle** | Consultative B2B | 2-8 week sales cycle requires direct relationship building, not automated nurturing |
| **Market Awareness** | Education-led | Category creation requires explaining why multi-account AI content works |
| **Scale Requirements** | Direct sales focus | Each client represents $2.5K-$20K MRR; high-touch sales justified by LTV |

**Channel Mix (Year 1):**
- **Outbound (55%):** Direct LinkedIn outreach, targeted email campaigns, industry event participation, strategic partnerships
- **Inbound (30%):** Case study content, organic social presence, referral programs, thought leadership
- **Performance (15%):** Small-scale PPC experiments for lead generation, retargeting

**Evolution Strategy:**
- **Year 1:** Outbound-heavy to acquire first 10 paying B2B clients and validate offering
- **Year 2:** Increase inbound share as case studies accumulate; build automated lead qualification
- **Year 3:** Balanced mix with 40% inbound / 40% outbound / 20% partnerships

## 6.2 Brand Positioning & Messaging

### Positioning Statement

**For** SMB business owners and digital marketing agencies who need scalable TikTok customer acquisition but lack internal capacity or expertise,

**Our** AI-powered multi-account content network is a performance-based traffic platform

**That** delivers targeted organic reach at 10-100x the scale of single-brand approaches while maintaining platform compliance through distributed architecture,

**Unlike** traditional influencer agencies (expensive and limited scale) or DIY content creation (impossible to scale and unpredictable),

**Because** our proprietary system combines 150+ accounts, AI-generated content, and algorithmic optimization to achieve predictable traffic volume at a fraction of the cost of paid advertising.

### Key Messages by Audience Segment

**Segment 1: "Overwhelmed Mike" - SMB Service Business Owner**

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| *"Stop hoping for viral hits. We deliver 100K-400K guaranteed views every month."* | Addresses unpredictability pain point |
| *"You don't need another TikTok expert. You need more leads. We get you leads."* | Bypasses platform anxiety, focuses on outcome |
| *"For less than the cost of one junior employee, get the output of 50 content creators."* | Price anchoring against familiar cost center |
| *"No more filming yourself. No more worrying about trends. We handle everything."* | Removes emotional friction with DIY content |

**Segment 2: "Scale-Hungry Sarah" - Course Creator / Digital Product Seller**

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| *"Your revenue shouldn't depend on how many hours you can spend creating content."* | Attacks core pain point directly |
| *"Traffic as a service: 1.5M+ monthly views, $0 ad spend, fully automated."* | Quantifies value proposition |
| *"We've cracked the code on TikTok algorithm. 150 accounts = statistical certainty."* | Appeals to data-driven mindset |
| *"Scale from $100K to $1M without scaling your content workload."* | Aspirational outcome framing |

**Segment 3: "Efficiency Eric" - Agency Owner**

| Message | Context |
|---------|---------|
| *"Add TikTok to your service offering without hiring a single specialist."* | Capacity expansion without headcount |
| *"White-label our network. Keep your margins. We stay invisible."* | Reseller economics |
| *"Your clients are asking for TikTok. We help you say 'yes' profitably."* | FOMO/competitor threat |
| *"75% gross margins on $2.5K-$20K/month retainers. Turnkey fulfillment."* | Direct financial appeal |

### Brand Voice & Tone

**Primary Attributes:**
- **Competent but not arrogant:** We know what we're doing, but we're still learning and optimizing
- **Transparent about platform risk:** We don't oversell or hide TikTok dependency; we manage it
- **Results-obsessed:** Every conversation returns to ROI, not vanity metrics
- **B2B professional:** Not "growth hacker" or "bro-marketer" style; we're a business partner, not a gimmick

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Avoid hype language ("explode your growth," "viral secrets")
- Use specific numbers whenever possible ("1.5M views," not "massive reach")
- Acknowledge limitations openly ("This approach isn't for everyone...")
- Focus on business outcomes, not platform features

### Brand Promise

**"Predictable TikTok traffic, guaranteed."**

**Supporting Promises:**
- Minimum view guarantee or we don't get paid
- Platform compliance through distributed architecture
- Full transparency on performance metrics
- Month-to-month contracts (we earn retention through results)

## 6.8 Social Media Plan

### Platform Strategy

**Philosophy:** We use social media strategically for B2B relationship building and proof, not B2C audience accumulation. We don't need followers; we need conversations.

| Platform | Audience Fit | Content Type | Frequency | KPI | Investment |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|------------|
| **LinkedIn** | HIGH (primary B2B channel) | Case studies, insights, company updates, client wins | 4-5 posts/week | Connection requests, meeting bookings, DMs | High (sales time + tools) |
| **TikTok** | MEDIUM (proof of capability) | Behind-the-scenes, content examples, viral marketing clips | 3-4 posts/week | Views, engagement, inbound inquiries | Medium (content repurposed from client work) |
| **Twitter/X** | LOW-MEDIUM (industry networking) | Threads on TikTok trends, marketing opinions | 2-3 posts/week | Engagement, industry connections | Low (repurposed content) |
| **YouTube** | LOW (long-form case studies) | Extended client testimonials, tutorials | 1 video/month | Watch time, search traffic | Low (opportunity cost) |

### LinkedIn Content Strategy

**Content Mix:**

| Content Type | % of Posts | Purpose | Example Topics |
|--------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Client Wins** | 40% | Social proof for consideration stage | "How we generated 200 leads for HVAC company in 30 days" |
| **Data Insights** | 25% | Thought leadership and expertise | "After 5M TikTok views, here's what we learned about the algorithm" |
| **Company Updates** | 15% | Momentum and credibility | "Just signed our 10th client. Here's what we've learned..." |
| **Industry Commentary** | 15% | Positioning and education | "Why TikTok ads will become obsolete for SMBs in 2026" |
| **Personal/Founder** | 5% | Humanization and trust | "Building a 150-account network taught me..." |

**LinkedIn Tactics:**
- **Sales Navigator:** Target by job title (Owner, CEO, CMO, Marketing Director)
- **Engagement:** Comment on prospects' posts before outreach
- **Video:** Native video outperforms text/images by 3-5x
- **Employee Advocacy:** Encourage team to share company posts
- **LinkedIn Groups:** Participate in marketing agency, SMB owner groups

**Success Metrics:**
- Profile views: 500-1,000/month
- Connection requests: 100-200/month
- Post engagement rate: >5% (likes + comments / views)
- DMs from prospects: 10-20/month

### TikTok Content Strategy

**Paradox:** We sell TikTok marketing but don't need a massive TikTok presence. Our TikTok is proof, not marketing.

**Content Approach:**
- **Behind-the-scenes:** Show our content pipeline (builds trust through transparency)
- **Client results:** Anonymized account performance screenshots
- **Educational:** How TikTok algorithm works (establishes expertise)
- **Viral clips:** Repurpose high-performing client content

**Accounts:**
- **Company account:** @ [TO BE DETERMINED] - Educational + client results
- **Founder account:** @ [TO BE DETERMINED] - Personal brand + insights
- **Niche accounts:** [TO BE DETERMINED] - Examples of our work in action

**Success Metrics:**

- Inbound inquiries: 5-10/month from TikTok
- Demo content performance: Use as proof for sales conversations

## 6.9 SEO / SEM Strategy

### SEM (Paid Search) Strategy

**Paid Search Allocation:**

| Platform | Monthly Budget | Purpose | Target Keywords | Expected ROI |

| **Google Ads** | $500 | Brand protection + competitor targeting | Brand terms + "TikTok marketing" | 2-3x (expensive but captures high intent) |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | $500 | Retargeting website visitors + content engagement | Website visitors + case study readers | 3-5x (expensive but precise B2B targeting) |
| **Retargeting** | $500 | Stay top-of-mind with engaged prospects | Website visitors, case study downloaders | 4-6x (highest ROI due to familiarity) |
| **TOTAL** | $1,500 | - | - | **3-5x weighted** |

**Ad Creative Approach:**
- **Headline:** Result-focused ("500 Leads in 30 Days with TikTok")
- **Social Proof:** Include client logos or metrics
- **CTA:** Low-friction ("See Case Study" not "Book Demo")
- **Landing Page:** Case study-specific landing pages, not homepage

**SEM Success Metrics:**
- CTR: >2% (LinkedIn), >3% (Google)
- Conversion rate: >5% (case study download)
- Cost per lead: <$200
- Retargeting conversion: >8%

- Value proposition focused on their industry
- Low-friction CTA ("Would you be open to seeing a case study?")

**Templates:** [IN CRM - personalized, not robotic]

**Response Rate Target:** >15%

**Exit Criteria:** Prospect replies or expresses interest

---

**Stage 3: Discovery Call (Week 1-2)**

**Agenda (20-30 minutes):**
1. **Their Business:** What they sell, who they target, current marketing
2. **Their Pain:** Why TikTok? Why now? What's not working?
3. **Their Goals:** What does success look like? (leads, sales, awareness)
4. **Our Fit:** Can we help? (niche alignment, capacity, timeline)

- "Who else will be involved in this decision?"

**Exit Criteria:** Prospect agrees to receive custom proposal

---

**Stage 4: Proposal & Education (Week 2-4)**

**Exit Criteria:** Prospect agrees to trial or negotiation

---

**Stage 5: Trial / Negotiation (Week 3-6)**

**Option A: Trial Campaign**

|-----------|----------|
| *"This is expensive."* | "Compared to what? One employee costs $4K/month and produces 2-3 videos. We produce 500 videos for $2.5K. What's an employee worth vs. 150 accounts?" |
| *"I'm skeptical this works."* | "Understandable. Let's do a 1-week trial for $500. If we don't deliver 50K views, you don't pay. Risk is on us." |
| *"I need to talk to my partner/Board."* | "Totally fair. What information do you need? I can hop on a call with them to answer questions directly." |
| *"We've tried agencies before with no results."* | "We're not an agency—we're a performance platform. We guarantee views or you don't pay. Traditional agencies can't do that." |
| *"TikTok seems risky/unstable."* | "It is. That's why we use 150 accounts—if 10 get banned, we still have 140. And we're expanding to Reels and Shorts in Q3." |
| *"Can I talk to a current client?"* | "Absolutely. Here are 3 clients in your space. Feel free to reach out—tell them I said hello." |

**Risk 3: Inability to Scale Sales Team**

**Probability:** Medium (40-60%)
**Impact:** Medium (Growth plateau, founder burnout)

**Mitigation:**
- Document playbooks extensively for easy transfer
- Hire sales talent with B2B SaaS experience
- Implement CRM and automation early
- Consider sales agency or contractors for flexibility

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Founder working 60+ hours/week on sales

---

**Risk 4: Market Skepticism About AI Content**

**Impact:** Medium-High (Lower conversion, need for more proof)

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on business outcomes, not methodology
- Use case studies to prove ROI regardless of content source
- Emphasize human curation and quality control

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Frequent questions about content authenticity
- Prospects requesting "human-created" content only
- Negative feedback about AI in sales calls

---

**Risk 5: Platform Risk Scaring Away Clients**

**Probability:** High (70-80%)
**Impact:** Medium (Longer sales cycles, smaller deal sizes)

**Mitigation:**
- Proactively address platform risk in first conversation
- Explain distributed network resilience (150 accounts = redundancy)
- Show account longevity data (prove we manage risk effectively)
- Offer month-to-month contracts (reduce client risk)
- Discuss multi-platform expansion roadmap

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Platform questions dominating discovery calls
- Clients requesting single-account options
- Concerns about TikTok ban or policy changes

---

**Risk 6: Partner Channel Underperformance**

**Probability:** Medium (40-50%)
**Impact:** Low-Medium (Slower growth, higher CAC)

**Mitigation:**
- Don't over-rely on partners in early stages
- Vet partners carefully before investing time
- Start with low-friction trial partnerships
- Diversify partnership types (agencies, consultants, platforms)

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Partners not generating promised leads
- High partner churn (partners dropping out)
- Low partner engagement (not promoting our service)
