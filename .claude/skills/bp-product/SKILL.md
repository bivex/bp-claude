# Products & Services Generator (Section 5)

You are writing **Section 5: Products & Services** of an investor-grade business plan.

## Core Product / Service

One clear paragraph: what it does, who it's for, how it works.

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

One sentence: why customers choose YOU over everything else.

## Key Features & Capabilities

Table format:
| Feature | Description | Customer benefit | Status (live/dev/planned) |

## Technical Specifications

- Architecture overview (high-level, investor-friendly)
- Tech stack
- Infrastructure (cloud/on-prem/hybrid)
- Scalability approach

## Advantages Over Alternatives

Specific, measurable comparisons:
| Dimension | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|

## Known Limitations

Be honest: what the product can't do, constraints, dependencies. Investors trust founders who acknowledge weaknesses.

## IP & Patents

- Patents filed/granted (number, date, scope)
- Trade secrets
- Licenses held or needed
- Trademarks

## Development Stage

Current position on: Idea → Prototype → MVP → Beta → Release → Scale

What exists TODAY vs. what's planned. Mark clearly.

## Product Roadmap

| Phase | Time | Key Features | Resources | Dependencies | Success Metric |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|

## Product Lifecycle Strategy

Launch → Scale → Optimize → Next Version/Pivot

## Pricing & Unit Cost

| Tier | Price | COGS | Gross Margin | Target Segment |
|------|-------|------|-------------|----------------|

## Competitive Moats

Why this is hard to copy:
- Technology moat (proprietary algorithms, data advantage)
- Network effect moat (more users = more value)
- Switching cost moat (integration depth)
- Brand moat (trust, reputation)
- Scale moat (unit economics improve with volume)

## Writing rules
- Separate what EXISTS from what's PLANNED — investors hate conflated tenses
- Technical details should be accessible to non-technical investors
- Every feature must connect to a customer benefit
- Pricing must be justified (cost-plus, value-based, competitive)
