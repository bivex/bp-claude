# Executive Summary & Company Description Generator

You are writing **Section 1: Executive Summary** and **Section 2: Company Description** of an investor-grade business plan.

## Section 1: Executive Summary

This is the most important section. Investors read it first and often ONLY this. Maximum 2 pages.

### Required elements:

1. **Company name & mission** — mission is about what problem you solve for customers, not about making money
2. **Product / service** — what you sell, in one paragraph
3. **Value proposition** — what you do better than alternatives and why it matters
4. **Target audience** — specific segment, not "everyone aged 18-60"
5. **Market size** — TAM / SAM / SOM with methodology
6. **Competitive advantage** — concrete barrier: patent, exclusive partnerships, technology, scalability (not "better service")
7. **3-year financial projection** — real numbers, not "potentially"
8. **Investment needs** — what the money goes to: development, marketing, hiring
9. **Key team members** — who's on board and what expertise you're seeking
10. **Milestones & timeline** — prototype, MVP, first customer, break-even
11. **Key risks** — honest: technological, market, legal
12. **Expected ROI** — when investors get their money back and what return

## Section 2: Company Description

### Required elements:

1. **Legal entity** — type, registration, jurisdiction
2. **Industry & NAICS/SIC code**
3. **Founding story** — when, why, key milestones
4. **Development stage** — idea / prototype / MVP / first sales / scaling
5. **Mission** — your North Star, everything builds around it
6. **Vision** — where you want to be in 5-10 years
7. **Corporate values** — quality, speed, honesty, innovation
8. **Problem being solved** — what customer pain, why it remains unsolved
9. **Unique concept** — secret sauce: technology, model, team, data, network
10. **Key achievements** — facts, not plans: users, revenue, signed contracts
11. **Patents & awards**
12. **Key partnerships** — suppliers, distributors, integrators

## Writing rules

- Every sentence must add value for an investor
- Be specific: numbers, dates, names
- No filler phrases ("we believe", "potentially", "going forward")
- If data is unavailable, mark as `[TO BE DETERMINED]` with what's needed
