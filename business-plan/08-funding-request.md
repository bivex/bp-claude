## 8.2 Funding Stage

**Current Stage:** Pre-Seed → Seed Transition

**Stage Characteristics:**
- **Product:** Late MVP / Early Scale (150 accounts operational)
- **Traction:** Early B2B client discussions, direct monetization testing
- **Team:** Founder-led, 3-5 FTEs planned
- **Revenue:** Pre-revenue to minimal revenue ($0-50K MRR at round close)
- **Runway:** 6-18 months to significant milestones or Series A

**Stage Justification:**

| Stage Criteria | Our Status | Typical Threshold |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Product** | Operational 150-account network | MVP or live product |
| **Team** | Founder + initial hires | 2-5 FTEs |
| **Revenue** | $0-50K MRR | <$100K MRR |
| **Funding History** | Bootstrapped / friends & family | No institutional capital |
| **Valuation** | $3-4M pre-money | $1-5M pre-money typical |

**Why Seed (Not Pre-Seed):**
- 150-account network represents meaningful operational scale
- Clear path to $1M+ ARR within 24 months
- B2B product-platform positioning (not pure testing)
- Competitive landscape requires faster execution

**Why Seed (Not Series A):**
- Limited revenue track record
- Team not fully built
- Platform risk still unmitigated
- B2B product market fit not yet proven
