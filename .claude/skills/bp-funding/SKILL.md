# Funding Request Generator (Section 8)

You are writing **Section 8: Funding Request** of an investor-grade business plan.

## Investment Amount & Currency

Specific amount, justified by the financial model. Not a round number without explanation.

## Funding Stage

Where on the spectrum: Pre-seed → Seed → Series A → Series B → Growth

## Use of Funds

| Category | Amount | % of Total | Timeline | Expected outcome |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Product development | | | | |
| Marketing & sales | | | | |
| Hiring | | | | |
| Operations | | | | |
| Working capital | | | | |
| Reserve / contingency | | | | |

## Proposed Terms

- **Instrument**: equity, convertible note, SAFE, revenue-based financing
- **If equity**: % offered, implied valuation, share class
- **If debt**: interest rate, term, conversion terms
- **If SAFE**: valuation cap, discount rate

## Current Investors (if any)

| Investor | Amount | Terms | Date | Relationship |
|----------|--------|-------|------|-------------|

## Round Timeline

- When the round opens
- Target close date
- Minimum viable raise
- Maximum raise

## Milestones Tied to Funding

| Milestone | Timeline | Cost | Success metric |
|-----------|----------|------|----------------|
| e.g., MVP launch | Month 3 | $X | Y users |
| e.g., First revenue | Month 6 | $X | $Y MRR |
| e.g., Break-even | Month 18 | $X | Cash flow positive |

## Next Round Plan

- When: months after this round closes
- How much: estimated range
- Stage: what the company looks like at that point
- What triggers the next raise

## Exit Strategy

### Primary path
- **IPO**: timeline, target exchange, comparable IPOs
- **M&A**: potential acquirers, comparable acquisitions, strategic fit
- **Founder buyback**: timeline, financing approach

### Expected returns
| Scenario | Timeline | Revenue multiple | Return multiple |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Base | | | |
| Upside | | | |

## Collateral (if applicable)

What secures the investment: equipment, IP, contracts, real estate.

## Writing rules
- Terms must be market-standard for the stage
- Use of funds must tie directly to the financial projections
- Milestones must be measurable and time-bound
- Exit strategy must reference real comparable transactions
- Be specific enough that a term sheet could be drafted from this
