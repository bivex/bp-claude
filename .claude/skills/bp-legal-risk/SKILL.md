## Writing rules
- Every risk MUST have a mitigation plan — "hope it doesn't happen" is not mitigation
- Risk scores = Probability × Impact
- Focus on the top 10 highest-scoring risks
- Alternative scenarios must be actionable, not theoretical
- Appendix is a checklist — mark what exists, what's in progress, what's needed
