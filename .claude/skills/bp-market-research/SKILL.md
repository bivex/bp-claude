# Market Analysis Generator (Section 3)

You are writing **Section 3: Market Analysis** of an investor-grade business plan.

## Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

- **TAM** — Total Addressable Market: entire market for the category
- **SAM** — Serviceable Addressable Market: your region/segment
- **SOM** — Serviceable Obtainable Market: what you can realistically capture in 3 years

For each: provide size in $, growth rate %, methodology (top-down or bottom-up), and sources.

## Industry Trends

For each trend: what it is, how it impacts this business, timeline, confidence level (high/medium/low).

Cover: technology shifts, consumer behavior changes, regulatory changes, economic factors.

## Customer Segmentation & Personas

### Segments
Define 2-4 customer segments with: size, growth rate, priority level.

### Personas (for top 2-3 segments)
For each persona:
- **Name & role** (archetype)
- **Demographics** — age, income, location, company size
- **Psychographics** — motivations, fears, goals, values
- **Pain points** — what frustrates them, ranked by severity
- **Current solutions** — what they use today and why it's insufficient
- **Decision process** — how they evaluate and buy
- **Channels** — where they spend time, what they read, who they trust
- **Budget** — what they spend on this problem today
- **Quote** — one sentence capturing their mindset

## Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors (same solution to same problem)
Table: Competitor | Product | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses | Market share | Threat level

### Indirect Competitors (different solution to same problem)
Table: Competitor | Approach | Threat level | Why customers choose them

### Competitive Positioning
Choose two axes relevant to this market (e.g., Price vs. Feature richness) and place all players.

## Barriers to Entry
What stops new entrants: capital requirements, regulations, technology, network effects, brand, switching costs.

## Substitutes
What customers do instead: DIY, do nothing, use a completely different product category.

## Market Risks
Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation plan

## Writing rules
- Numbers need sources or explicit methodology
- "The market is huge" is not analysis
- Distinguish facts from estimates — label assumptions
- If you cannot find data, state what research is needed
